# Location App

Welcome to the **Location App**! This Kotlin project is designed to provide users with the current location of their device, offering both precise "fine" location details, including longitude, latitude, and address, as well as a less accurate "coarse" location.

## Features

- **User-Friendly UI**: The app boasts a simple and intuitive user interface with a prominent button labeled "#Location," making it easy for users to interact with the application.

- **Location Retrieval**: Upon tapping the "#Location" button, the app retrieves and displays the current location of the device.

- **Permission System**: To enhance user privacy and security, the app includes a permission system. Users are prompted to grant permission for accessing their location. The app supports both "#FineLocation," providing extremely accurate coordinates, and "#CoarseLocation," offering less precise details.
